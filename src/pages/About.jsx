                This project focuses on clarity, structure, and intention. No visual
                noise, no unnecessary abstraction — just clean interfaces that respect
                the user.
                </p>

                Built with React and Tailwind, the goal is to stay lightweight while
                remaining expressive. Design decisions are deliberate, not decorative.
